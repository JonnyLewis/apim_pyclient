# How to get swagger definitions for Store Publisher REST APIS ?

Start [WSO2 API Manager](http://wso2.com/api-management/) server. You can get the swagger definitions for store and publisher REST APIs in following locations.

* Store : https://localhost:9292/api/am/store/v1.0/apis/swagger.json
* Publisher : https://localhost:9292/api/am/publisher/v1.0/apis/swagger.json

You need to change the `API version` , `hostname` and `port` accordingly.
